# Lowest Common-Ancestor
CS3012 Assignment

## Task
* Lowest Common Ancestor for a directed acyclic graph.
* Choose a unit testing framework. A comprehensive by language list is available here.
* Create a repository on a git service such as Github. Your work will be implemented in this repository.
* Define a set of initial unit tests that capture the basic expected behaviour. This will require you to create sample data and also to identify the basic API for your solution.
* Build your initial solution, testing it against your test code until it is working.
* Refine the solution, expanding your test cases to deal with awkward parameters and edge cases that push the limits of your solution, enhancing your solution to deal with these.

### My implementation
I have decided to implement the solution with the unit testing using Python.
Dag structure is stored as predecessor and successor of nodes.
in order to run the test you must be inside the `Src` then run the command `pyhton .\test.py`
