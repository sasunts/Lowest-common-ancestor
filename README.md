# Lowest Common-Ancestor
CS3012 Assignment
My first Haskell program.

## Task
* Lowest Common Ancestor for a binary tree.
* Choose a unit testing framework. A comprehensive by language list is available here.
* Create a repository on a git service such as Github. Your work will be implemented in this repository.
* Define a set of initial unit tests that capture the basic expected behaviour. This will require you to create sample data and also to identify the basic API for your solution.
* Build your initial solution, testing it against your test code until it is working.
* Refine the solution, expanding your test cases to deal with awkward parameters and edge cases that push the limits of your solution, enhancing your solution to deal with these.

### My implementation
I have decided to implement the solution with the unit testing using Haskell.
The main lca function has came from a resource online, tweaked to match what is needed.
First test implemented.
in order to run the test you must be inside the `LCA_src` then run the command `runhaskell ./LcaSpec.hs`

#### TODO:   
* Unit test lca for all possible scenarios.
* Maybe write script to run tests.
* Comment and documentation for the code.
* Commit more!
* Prepare for a branch
